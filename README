libaan - A library for all and none
  Where all is pointed more at the usecases than at the users

What
  Code snippets I needed more than once.
  Small c++11 wrappers for low level system functionality.
  Only headers(yet).
  Some unit tests. There should be more.
  Serves mostly as reminder of some c++ techniques, but is also used as include
  library in some of my applications.

Outline
  Global namespace libaan for all introduced types and functions.
  Additional namespaces to encapsulate functionality better, e.g. x11, file.

Use
  Include repository as git submodule and directly reference .hh files.

Missing
  tests
  unused/duplicated code should be removed or refactored.
  replace namespace util with module namespace..
  .cc files
