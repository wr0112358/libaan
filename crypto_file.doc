File encryption for small files that are rewritten completely when changed.

file format:
64bytes unencrypted header
variable number of camellia 256 encrypted blocks in cbc mode

header format:
8 bytes magic string
4 bytes version string
camelia256::saltsize byte salt
camelia256::blocksize bytes iv


camelia256::saltsize = 16
camelia256::blocksize = 16
camelia256::keysize = 32


usage:

A. create file:
1. fill salt/iv with rng from /dev/random
2. write header to file

B. read file:
1. read existing iv/salt from header
2. take user provided password and salt from file header to generate a
   key of length camelia256::keysize with pbkdf2_pkcs5 algorithm
3. read the whole encrypted file in a buffer and decrypt using key and iv

C. write file:
1. read existing iv/salt from header
2. take user provided password and salt from file header to generate a
   key of length camelia256::keysize with pbkdf2_pkcs5 algorithm
3. get new iv from /dev/random
4. encrypt provided buffer using key and the iv from step C.3. update and
   write header and all blocks to file.


Questions:
Is it ok to reuse the iv?
   No.
-> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_modes_of_operation#Initialization_vector_.28IV.29
   "...in most cases, it is important that an initialization vector is
   never reused under the same key.
   For CBC and CFB, reusing an IV leaks some information about the
   first block of plaintext, and about any common prefix shared by the
   two messages.
   For OFB and CTR, reusing an IV completely destroys security.[6]
   This can be seen because both modes effectively create a bitstream
   that is XORed with the plaintext, and this bitstream is dependent
   on the password and IV only.
   Reusing a bitstream destroys security.[8] In CBC mode, the IV must,
   in addition, be unpredictable at encryption time; in particular,
   the (previously) common practice of re-using the last ciphertext
   block of a message as the IV for the next message is insecure (for
   example, this method was used by SSL 2.0).
   If an attacker knows the IV (or the previous block of ciphertext)
   before he specifies the next plaintext, he can check his guess
   about plaintext of some block that was encrypted with the same key
   before (this is known as the TLS CBC IV attack)."

Is it ok to reuse the salt?


Possible improvements:
Generate master_key with pbkdf2_pkcs5 alorithm using stored constant salt+password as input.
salt can be reused.
-> how to get unique iv from this master_key?

Use a different cpher mode like GCM or EAX: IV can be a counter, no padding necessary.
-> would make file protocoll/io easier.
-> openssl support?

provide integrity with a MAC
  "CBC does not ensure integrity. Usually, when you need to encrypt
  (for confidentiality), you also need to reliably detect hostile
  alterations. For that, you need a MAC. Assembling a MAC and
  encryption is tricky."
-> using GCM or EAX mode would make this unnecessary
