libaan - A library for all and none

What
  Code snippets I needed more than once.
  Small c++11 wrappers for low level system functionality.
  Only headers(yet).
  Serves mostly as reminder of some c++ techniques, but is also used as include
  library in some of my applications.

Outline
  Global namespace libaan for all introduced types and functions.
  Additional namespaces to encapsulate functionality better, e.g. x11, file.

Use
  Include repository as git submodule and directly reference .hh files.

Missing
  namespaces 
  .cc files


Compiling for Windows might work at times provided the preprocessor define
NO_GOOD is set
